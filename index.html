<h2>Everything you love, and more</h2>

<br>
<h2>Gorgeously rendered graphics</h2>
<p>With Unreal Engine 5, expansive stages are rendered with cutting-edge technology. Incredible new graphics bring the wild growth of the jungles, forests, and swamps to life in exquisite detail.

<br>
<h2>Authentic to life portrayals</h2>
<p>The battle damage system has been upgraded, with the wear and tear of Snake's clothes, as well as bruises and bullet wounds on his body, reflected in real time. Injuries will leave their mark on Snake's body permanently, telling a story of each player's unique journey through the game.</p>

<h3>STORY</h3>
<h2>The Cold War Crisis that started it all</h2>
<p>In the middle of the Cold War, Naked Snake, the man who would later be known as Big Boss, infiltrates the Soviet Union to escort a defecting scientist, Sokolov. However, the mission ends in failure when Snake's mentor—The Boss, a soldier known as the mother of special forces—betrays him, and Sokolov is captured by Colonel Volgin of the GRU.</p>
<br>
<p>One week later, Snake returns to Soviet territory to rescue Sokolov and eliminate The Boss—a mission that will mark the start of a new legend, against the backdrop of the ever-changing march of history.</p>
<br>
<p>This epic installment tells the story of the birth of the hero known as Big Boss, the very start of the Metal Gear Saga.</p>
